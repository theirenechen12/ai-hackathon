"""
Playwright browser launcher for ai-hackathon.

Opens the EduTrivia app at localhost:8000 in a non-headless browser
so you can view the UI alongside the code.

Run the FastAPI server first:
    cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

Then in a separate terminal:
    cd Playwright && python main.py
